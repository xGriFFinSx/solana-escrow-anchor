# Solana Escrow Program (Anchor) — In Progress

This repository contains an **experimental Solana escrow smart contract** written in **Rust**, built as part of my learning journey into Solana program development using the **Anchor framework**.

The goal of this project is to understand how escrow-style logic works on Solana, including account management, instruction flow, and basic security considerations commonly used in DeFi protocols.

## 📌 Project Status
**In Progress / Learning Project**

This program is not production-ready and is actively being iterated on while I study:
- Anchor account constraints
- Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
- Instruction validation
- Testing and debugging workflows

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Understand Solana **account architecture** and ownership rules  
- Learn how **escrow patterns** are implemented in smart contracts  
- Use **Anchor** to structure programs and reduce common security mistakes  
- Write and run tests to validate program behavior  
- Debug transaction failures using logs and Anchor test tools  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Rust
- Solana
- Anchor Framework
- Solana CLI
- Anchor CLI

---

## 🔍 Features (Current / Planned)
- [x] Program scaffolding using Anchor
- [x] Basic instruction structure
- [ ] Escrow initialization logic
- [ ] Deposit and release conditions
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Security checks and edge-case handling

---

## 🧪 Testing
Tests are written using Anchor’s testing framework to:
- Validate instruction execution
- Identify logic or account constraint errors
- Practice debugging failed transactions

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is for **educational purposes only** and should not be used in production environments.

---

## 🚀 Motivation
I am building this project to gain hands-on experience with Solana smart contracts and to prepare for contributing to real-world, production-grade DeFi systems under mentorship.
